Ball Simulator 2015 - Phaser.js Edition
==========
***Because I'm bored***

A remake of my friends iOS game, using Phaser.js


ToDo
=====

* Circular canvas
* site color changes
* use html/css for menu buttons
* see if css can work on phaser objects
* when you eat a ball you get it's size * opacity added to your size
* special ball thats a bit bigger than you, glows and sparkles, moves slow. you eat that and you're invincible for 10 seconds, small balls are all green and bigger are all red
* as time goes on, random speed gets shifter higher, and random ball size scales. the proportion scales too. so beginning is 75% smaller ones, and goes down to 10% smaller as time goes on, and the range is always half your size to 1.5 your size
* the chances of special ball is better when more people play at same time, look into google analytics
